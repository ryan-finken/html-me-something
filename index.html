                Ryan and Corey's Cat Family

            <p>
                Corey and I met in 2013. Since then, we've moved in
                and introduced our cats, added two more, and gotten married!
                Get to know the whole gang down below.

                    <p>
                        Zoe is the first cat I adopted. I found her when she was
                        about 6 months old, and have had her since 2010. She has
                        a bit of a mean streak, but she can be quite charming once
                        you get to know her. She's the oldest cat in the house.

                    <p>
                        My wife adopted Loretta before I met either of them;
                        they have been together since 2011, and Corey adopted Loretta
                        when she was a very young kitten. Loretta hated me for the first
                        2 years we lived together, but we're buds now. The key to getting
                        along with Loretta is to respect her boundaries.

                        Hugo is a sweet boy who loves to cuddle and laze
                        about. He is very fond of Corey, and everyone else
                        in the house is fond of him. Corey adopted him before we met,
                        and he is a little older than Loretta.He is probably the 
                        biggest cat you've ever seen.

                        Miles is the first cat Corey and I adopted together.
                        He is very friendly, funny, and chill; he can be a jerk
                        to his sisters sometimes, but really loves his brother
                        Hugo. Miles is about 4 years old.
